# Cat vs Dog Classification Using VGG16

This project implements a binary image classification model to distinguish between cats and dogs. The model is built using the VGG16 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned with custom dense layers. Data augmentation is applied to the training dataset for better generalization. The model is trained, evaluated, and saved for deployment or future use.

## Project Overview

The project uses transfer learning with VGG16 to classify images of cats and dogs. The training dataset undergoes augmentation to improve model robustness. Early stopping and model checkpointing are employed to optimize training. The final trained model is evaluated on a test dataset and achieves a satisfactory level of accuracy.


## Directory Structure

The dataset should be organized into the following directory structure:

/output
│
├── train/
│   ├── cats/
│   ├── dogs/
│
├── val/
│   ├── cats/
│   ├── dogs/
│
├── test/
    ├── cats/
    ├── dogs/

- **train/**: Training data for model training.
- **val/**: Validation data for tuning model parameters.
- **test/**: Test data for evaluating model performance.


## Model Details

- **Base Model**: VGG16 (pre-trained on ImageNet, without the top layer).
- **Custom Layers**:
  - A flattening layer.
  - Dense layer with 256 neurons and ReLU activation.
  - Dropout layer for regularization.
  - Dense output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.

## Dependencies

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-dog-classifier.git
cd cat-dog-classifier
```

### 2. Prepare the Dataset

Ensure the dataset is structured as described in the [Directory Structure](#directory-structure) section and place it in the `output/` directory.

### 3. Train the Model

Run the Python script to train the model:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This script:
- Loads the dataset.
- Applies data augmentation to the training data.
- Builds the VGG16-based model.
- Trains the model with early stopping and checkpoints.
- Saves the final model as `final_cat_dog_classifier.keras`.

### 4. Evaluate the Model

The script evaluates the trained model on the test set and prints the test accuracy. Performance graphs for training and validation loss/accuracy are also displayed.

## Results

The model achieves the following results:
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~85% (varies based on training)
- **Test Accuracy**: ~84% (varies based on training)
